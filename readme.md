## Project

### Communicate Data Findings

- DataSet : Ford GoBike System Data

## Project Context

- This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

    - **Exploratory data analysis**
        > In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, understand the dataâ€™s structure,patterns and relationships. starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

    - **Explanatory data analysis** 
        > In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Dataset

- [Ford GoBike System Data](https://www.bikeshare.com/data/) \
  This data set includes information about individual rides made
  in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
  Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

- The Average trip Duration is ~ 9 min.
- the average trip distance after is ~ 1.58 km.
- The System have two user types ( 90.5% Subscribers and 9.5% Customers).
- Customers Users have longer trips than Subscribers.
    - On Average, For Customers ~12 min. and For Subscribers ~ 9 min.
- The Majority of System Subscribers are Males (75% Males ,23% Females and 2% Other).
- Females have slightly longer trips than Male.
    - On Average, For Females ~ 10 min. and For Males ~9 min.
- There are two Peaks for Starting trip hour at 8am and 5pm.
- There are remarkable decrease in Starting trip in Weekends , and also increase in trip duration during weekends.
- Members Ages have no strong effect in trip duration.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- I'll start by presenting the main feature we want to analyze (trip duration) and explore other features that have relation with our interest feature like (user type, member gender, trip start time, trip start day).

- Then, I'll try to confirm our interpreting by adding features to equation
    - Explore the relation between User Type and Trip Duration.
    - Explore the relation between  Trip duration, User Type and member gender.
    - Explore the relation between Trip duration, Start trip Day and  member gender.

- Insights:
    - On Average , Trips took about 9 minutes.
    - The Most Frequent Day for Starting Trips is Thursday , and the Least are (Saturday/Sunday) the weekends.
    - In Weekends , trips duration have a little increase than other week days. 
    - Th Most busy hours during the day are 8am and 5pm , and the Least are from 12am to 5am.
    - The System has two types of users (Customers and Subscribers) and most of The Users are Subscribers.
    - On Average , Customers have longer trips than subscribers and Female users have longer trips than males.
